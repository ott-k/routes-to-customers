# routes-to-customers

Proposed solution is presented in "routes_to_customers.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook file.

In order for the script to work notebook file and "customer_address.csv" file should be in the same directory andin the notebook file user info at "gis = GIS('pro')" should be changed if ArcGIS Pro isn't installed.
