# routes-to-customers

Proposed solution is presented in "routes_to_customers.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.

Notebook file and "customer_address.csv" file should be in the same directory in order for the script to work. In the Notebook user info at line with "gis = GIS('pro')" should be changed if ArcGIS Pro isn't installed.
